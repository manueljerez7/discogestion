	$snmp set [OID] [DEVICE_NAME] [VALUE]: Execute a SNMP-SET command 
	$snmp walk [OID] [DEVICE_NAME]: Returns all values of a table as a list
	$snmp tabla [OID] [DEVICE_NAME]: Returns a table as a .txt file
	$sondeo [MODE(ABS o DELTA)] [OID] [TIME_SECONDS] [N_SAMPLES] [DEVICE_NAME]: Returns a graphic with the evolution of the specified value
	$snmp informe [DEVICE_NAME]: Returns a PDF document with some relevant information about the device
	$monitorizar [MODE(ABS o DELTA)] [mayor(higher)/menor(lower)] [OID] [THRESHOLD] [TIME_SECONDS]: Monitors the value of the specified OID and returns an alert
	NOTE: It is not necessary to add .0 when writing the OID

NOTES ABOUT THE PROJECT:
We are aware that the code written is not nice, we are not proffessional programmers and we had a lot of problems during the development of the project
The generation of the PDF can take some time as it has some graphics and photos that need to be proccessed
The monitoring function stops when generates an alert, the command has to be re-sent if tou want to continue with the comparation
Some tables doesn't display properly if they don't have an integer index column
MIBS available are in the folder "mibs", and they can be added to the project changing the parametrs of loadModules function in index.py, but we do not guarantee that they will
	work, as we only tried some of them.
	
Explanation of the files:
index.py: Main file
acciones.py, trap.py, informe.py: Functions of the different commands available
CrearFoto.py: Auxiliar function that converts .txt files to photos to add them to the PDF
traductor.py: Auxiliar function that converts OID names to values
